# USING FLUXLOADER ON MAC
### Here is a guide to how to run the Sandustry modloader, called Fluxloader, on a mac.

1. You will want to download Fluxloader first ofc. You can find it at https://github.com/fluxloader-team/fluxloader/releases. Make sure to get the correct one for your OS (apple silicon is arm).

2. Try opening Fluxloader (after unzipping ofc). If going to settings > security & privacy and clicking open anyway doesn't work you might have to run a command in the terminal.
2b. If you couldn't open it by clicking open anyway that means Gatekeeper (iirc that's what apple's security system is called) won't let you. To tell Gatekeeper the app is safe you will need to run a command. To do so, open terminal then type/paste `xattr -c ` in. To specify what file drag the app in. Doing that should give you something like `xattr -c /Desktop/Fluxloader.app`. Lastly, run the command by pressing enter and Fluxloader should be openable!

3. Now, you will need the app.asar of the game to actually play it. To get it, click the green code button on the top right then click download as zip. After you unzip it, open up fluxloader, go to the config tab at the top, and change the game path to point at the folder you just unzipped.

4. Enjoy the many mods on fluxloader! (Using the fluxloader is the same on any OS)
